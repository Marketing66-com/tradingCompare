    <h2 class="review_top-title review_margin-top">Security and Privacy</h2>
    <p class="review_top-text review_margin-top">Based out of Limassol, Cyprus, Alvexo opened its gates for trading as recently as 2014 and it's operated by a renowned financial investment company VPR Safe Financial Group Limited. Forex and commodity trading market is fierce and usually not kind to players who are trying to earn trust and integrity in the market. However, Alvexo has done quite well so far in terms of building platform's reliability and trustworthiness. </p>
    <p class="review_top-text review_margin-top">It should be noted that Alvexo is regulated by the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC) and the platform is in compliance of all the requirements and conditions put forth by Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID). </p>
    <p class="review_top-text review_margin-top">This means that the platform operates under rigorous financial oversight that includes monitoring, regular audits by certified accounting firms and the ability to maintain minimum capital. Moreover, the trading platform keeps clients' funds in a separate account that can only be used for making payments to the clients. As far as the digital security is considered, Alvexo has taken strict measures to ensure every user's privacy is protected through 256 bit RapidSSL encryption.</p>
