                        <p class="content-text_min-text">As the trade volumes are reaching billions of dollars a day and the market caps are hitting tens of billions of dollars, it is no wonder that cryptocurrencies fuel the modern day gold rush. Today is an age of digital currencies, with hundreds of cryptocurrencies birthed within the decade. There are already more than a thousand cryptocurrencies in the market, and almost daily a new initial coin offering (ICO) appears.
                        </p>
                        <h4 class="content-text_title ">What is Cryptocurrency?</h4>
                        <p class="content-text_min-text">Today, the most famous cryptocurrency is Bitcoin. Its inventor attempted to build a Òpeer-to-peer electronic cash systemÓ. Many have tried this system many times before. However, the main difference between Bitcoin and the previous efforts, like Digicash, was that it was to be entirely decentralized. Since no overarching entity is controlling the currency, the notion of ÒtrustÓ would be eliminated from the system.
                        </p>
                        <p class="content-text_min-text">To combat Òdouble spendingÓ, the major problem in all the digital cash systems at that point, Satoshi Nakamoto, BitcoinÕs inventor, proposed the blockchain technology. The blockchain technology is a revolutionary technology that records all the transactions made with this currency.
                        </p>
                        <p class="content-text_min-text">For any single balance, transaction, or change to the network to take place, there needs to be a consensus amongst those who validate the network Ð the miners. Since the invention of Bitcoin, many programmers have attempted to use the model and change it to provide what they consider a more functional form of digital cash.
                        </p>
                        <p class="content-text_min-text">The other kinds of cryptocurrencies include Monero, New Economy Movement, Litecoin, and Ether.

                        <p class="content-text_min-text">
                            Since cryptocurrency is such a new technology, it may be that people have not used it yet for its eventual use. Still, today people utilize it for many various purposes. These purposes include, but arenÕt limited to the following: trading, remittances, payment for goods and services, investment, gambling, private monetary transactions, and as a hedge against national currencies which are suffering from rapid devaluation (Greece, Venezuela for example).

                        <p class="content-text_min-text">

                        <p class="content-text_min-text">What is the difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum?
                            All cryptocurrencies have their own characteristics. However, recently one coin has come to challenge Bitcoin more than ever before. Ethereum is the new player on the market. The reasons that it is a challenge to Bitcoin are easy to understand.

                        <p class="content-text_min-text">Ethereum emerged as an effort to try to correct some of the main criticisms made towards Bitcoin Ð especially regarding security.
                        </p>
                        <p class="content-text_min-text">What Ethereum has accomplished to do was to provide transactions that are safer, more flexible contracts that are compatible with any wallet, with short block times for negotiating (where the confirmations are easier). Also, Ethereum is available more than Bitcoin. Whereas more than two-thirds of Bitcoin has already been mined, access to ethereum is still widely available. Another main difference between these two cryptocurrencies is that Ethereum allows for different developers to raise funds for their projects. It can, therefore, be in itself a Kickstarter for some projects.

                        <p class="content-text_min-text">One of the main advantages to Ethereum is that itÕs a more secure, easy to use, flexible, and transact coin. In addition to this advantage, it has brought innovations in terms of entrepreneurship and investment. And this is posing a serious challenge to BitcoinÕs market cap.
