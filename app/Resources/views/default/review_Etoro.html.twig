                    <p class="review_top-text review_margin-top">&nbsp;	&nbsp;	&nbsp;eToro was established as RetailFX in 2006 and today it has become the leading social trading platform for all types of investors from the most experienced ones to those who are just starting out. The platform was developed by brothers Yoni Assia and Ronen Assia in partnership with David Ring. The vision of eToro was to develop a platform that makes investment easy and user-friendly for all kinds of investors regardless of their experience. </p>
                    <p class="review_top-text review_margin-top">The struggle of the brothers paid off as the idea generated a lot of interest and eToro has now become your go to social trading platforms serving millions of customers globally.</p>

                    <h2 class="review_top-title review_margin-top">How eToro Works</h2>
                    <p class="review_top-text review_margin-top">eToro debuted the OpenBook trading platform which introduced an innovative way for investors to deal in a range of financial instruments including currencies, market indices, commodities, equities and cryptocurrencies. Another groundbreaking feature that was introduced was CopyTrading. It allowed newbie investors to copy the trades of the investors who have established themselves as successful and reliable traders with consistent returns. This enabled veterans to share their knowledge while the less experienced ones found the way to leverage that information to make profitable trades for themselves.  </p>
                    <div class="review_general-container-img "><img class="review_top-brandn_img" src='{{asset("img/Reviews/Etoro/etoro-review.PNG")}}' alt="etoro-review"></div>

                    <h2 class="review_top-title review_margin-top">Contract for Difference</h2>
                    <p class="review_top-text review_margin-top">A Contract for Difference or CFD is fundamentally derivative trading where a trader speculates on the future performance of relatively volatile financial markets including indices, fiat currencies, treasuries, commodities, shares, and cryptocurrencies. The biggest difference is that you don't actually buy or sell the asset itself but invest in the unit(s) representing that asset's performance. You make profit or loss by correctly or incorrectly predicting whether a certain asset's price will rise or fall.</p>
                    <p class="review_top-text review_margin-top">If the price behaves according to your predictions, the number of units you own increase and vice versa. Deliberation and caution must be exercised at all times since you can lose more than you have deposited.</p>
                    <p class="review_top-text review_margin-top">The CFD model has proven to be very successful in the era of cryptocurrency revolution since it provides a stable way of investing in a rather volatile asset whose price moves every few seconds.</p>

                    <h2 class="review_top-title review_margin-top">Trade Markets on eToro</h2><br>
                    <p class="review_top-text review_margin-top">On eToro, investors can trade in many asset classes including: </p>

                    <h2 class="review_top-title review_margin-top">CopyTrading Feature</h2>
                    <p class="review_top-text review_margin-top">One of the most successful features of eToro is CopyTrading.

Popular investors also receive awards for sharing their knowledge. On the other hand, invetors who have just stepped into the arena have higher odds of making money right away since they don't need to invest their time in research sweating over numbers and stats.</p>


                    <h2 class="review_top-title review_margin-top">User Interface and Friendliness</h2>

In 2014, eToro was one of the first trading websites to bring Bitcoin to the platform. That being said, on eToro cryptocurrencies are traded as a derivative of CFD instead of an asset or currency.</p>
        <p class="review_top-text review_margin-top">For trading the above instruments, you can also make a practice account to test the waters before signing up for the real deal. You're given $100,000 in virtual currency to practice and make trades. This way you can test the opportunities for yourself before investing any real money.</p>
        <p class="review_top-text review_margin-top">Moreover, Muslims can also request an Islamic trading account which allows you to trade in financial markets that don't violate principles of Islamic Sharia.</p>

        <h2 class="review_top-title review_margin-top">Customer Care</h2>
        <p class="review_top-text review_margin-top">Good news is eToro provides highly cooperative and helpful customer support but the bad news is that's only five days a week. Instant customer assistance is not available during weekends. However, you can still reach out to the customer service through fax and email.</p>
