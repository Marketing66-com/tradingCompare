                    <h4 class="content-text_title center">What are Stocks ?</h4>
                    <p class="content-text_min-text">It’s not unusual to hear people talk about stocks whenever the topic of financial investments comes up. They are a common form of investing and there are even entire markets such as the New York Stock Exchange that are dedicate to these types of investments.</p>
                    <p class="content-text_min-text">Securities, on the other hand, are financial deeds or contracts that establish property rights of a company in the form of shares, or ownership rights in the form of bonds. In terms of investments, whether we make our investment in the forms of shares or bonds, we aim to make a profit by speculating that we will be able to sell our shares in the future once more investors begin paying higher prices for their shares.</p>
                    <p class="content-text_min-text">In simpler terms, we can compare shares and securities as contracts that establish co-ownership of a specific company or project. It is, however, necessary to differentiate between the titles that are ordinarily given by the State or Central Bank, from shares are securities that are relevant to the ownership of a company.</p>

                    <h4 class="content-text_title ">Where is the Profit ?</h4>
                    <p class="content-text_min-text">
                        Stocks and Bonds are both securities and are not some abstract concept that magically generates interest and dividends. Instead, they are a way for companies to mobilize their capital, which allows them to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Explore new business prospects for the future.</li>
                        <li>  Improved their products and services.</li>
                        <li>Expand their business and improve their reputation.</li>
                        <li>Recruit employees with better qualifications.</li>
                    </ul></p>
                    <p class="content-text_min-text">Whatever they may be, the reasons for a company to sell their shares on the stock exchange comes from the company’s managers who wish to improve their service. Another reason for this is that it gives investors a reason to invest in the company since they will be able to generate returns on their initial investment as the company improves their bottom line.</p>

                    <h4 class="content-text_title ">How Much Does It Take?</h4>
                    <p class="content-text_min-text">Possessing a company’s stocks gives you the title of shareholders and as such, own a part of the company or project. This allows you to benefit from the company’s operations every time that they make a profit.</p>
                    <p class="content-text_min-text">Unlike bonds, holding shares exposes you financially in the event of any bad moves by the company and can even cause you to lose more than you invested. However, it is possible to transfer your shares to a third-party or person who will then benefit from the interest gained or lost on the investment.</p>
                    <p class="content-text_min-text">The price of a share fluctuates daily not only because they are at the mercy of the current market conditions in which a company operates, but also because of the confidence of the other investors who are also shareholders. Moreover, during a trade or sales exchange, shares always retain their current value until the transaction is complete.</p>
                    <p class="content-text_min-text">Bonds, on the other hand, are contractually binding and never suffer from deferrals or fluctuating market prices. By issuing bonds, a company is legally required to pay out dividends, as well as any capital within a set time frame.</p>
                    <p class="content-text_min-text">Stocks and bonds seem to be one of the ultimate forms of investment that one might want to familiarize themselves with and understand. These types of financial assets often provide investors with massive gains in short time periods and no matter the market, are always feeding the desires of young investors who are looking to make a fortune.</p>
                    <p class="content-text_min-text">These days, cryptocurrencies are the most promising type of investment available on the market. Completely different from traditional stocks, cryptocurrencies represent a financial revolution and threaten to completely overthrow every sector of industry, as well as making their way directly and indirectly into the lives of regular people.</p>
                    <p class="content-text_min-text">Therefore, by thinking ahead and making use of this newer type of investment, you’ll be taking a step towards modernizing the way that you manage every aspect of your finances.</p>
